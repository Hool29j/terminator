                          <div class="accordion-body">White rice is milled to remove the bran and germ, which makes it more shelf-stable but also removes some of the fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Brown rice is left whole, so it retains the bran and germ, which makes it more nutritious but also more perishable. Brown rice takes longer to cook than white rice, but it is a healthier option.</div>

                          <div class="accordion-body"> Broth and stock are both made by simmering meat, bones, vegetables, and herbs in water, but broth typically includes more meat and seasonings, while stock is made with mostly bones and vegetables. Broth is often used as a base for soups and stews, while stock is used as a base for sauces and gravies.</div>
